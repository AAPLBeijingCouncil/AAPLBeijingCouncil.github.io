            <p class="introduction">
                The AAPL Beijing Council is a diverse group of talented Apple users. AAPL is the stock code of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).
                We do not own the name AAPL, these four uppercase letters simply represent what we value and believe in.
                Beijing is the capital of the People’s Republic of China, the host country of this user group and home to
                most of our members.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction">
                However, our members — including software and hardware experts, former employees, shareholders, professionals from other
                companies, as well as regular Apple users — are located all over the world, not exclusive to Beijing.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction">
                Our primary achievements include loads of bug reports and unique, creative feature suggestions. Moreover, we are not only
                concerned and confident about Apple’s business and products, but also proud to have such an innovative and
                responsible company in this world pushing the human race forward.
